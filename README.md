# UI-UX-Design
We worked on this project after realizing that the current donation system for the Campus Cupboard faces significant usability and accessibility challenges, leading to decreased donor participation and engagement. Potential donors, including students, faculty, and community members, struggle with complex navigation, unclear instructions, and limited payment options. This highlights the need for a user-friendly and inclusive app that streamlines the donation process, enhances engagement, and aligns with modern digital expectations. The project's goals include improving usability, accessibility, and donor engagement by creating an intuitive, efficient, and motivating donation platform tailored to diverse user needs.
